# X & Y to Latitude & Longitude Conversion

A short script to convert XY coordinates into lat and long.

This script will take a CSV file as an input for a pandas data frame, convert the specified X and Y columns into latitude and longitude, and return two new CSVs; one with only the newly created coordinates, and one being the original input with the new coordinate columns appended.
